# Structure of my Website

## Assets

Assets will be further broken down into `css`, `js`, and `images` folders.

## Root

The root will contain just the landing page and the projects page. Assets for the root page will go in the 'assets' folder.

## Labs

Labs will go in `labs/lab<num>`. For example, Lab #3 will go in `labs/lab3`.

Each lab will have an `index.html` file, an `instructions.md`/`instructions.html` file, and a `solution.html` file. Each lab will have an optional `assets` folder as defined earlier.

## Final Project

The final project will have the same structure as a lab folder.
